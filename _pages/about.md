I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics with extensive experience as a Graduate Research Assistant, showcasing a strong background in statistical research. I have also worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, instructing Math, Statistics, and Data courses over the past few years. I am proficient in statistical modeling, data analysis, research, teaching, and education. My academic credentials include a Master of Arts in Statistics from York University, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Mathematics with a focus on Statistics at UBC.

My expertise includes statistical modelling, data analytics, university teaching, and programming skills (R, Python, SAS, SQL, Git, etc.). Over the past five years, I've worked on developing advanced statistical models for analyzing wildfire patterns and environmental trends. What really drives me is a process of continuous exploration and advancement - learning new technologies, building useful tools, and solving problems.  

Outside of work and studies, I'm interested in exploring nature and connecting with plants. Sometimes, when inspiration strikes, I pick up my brushes and paint a watercolor, capturing the beauty of landscapes and flowers.

I’m always seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about statistics, data, technologies, or camping.
